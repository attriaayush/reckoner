# Reckoner

Finding the right investments for your portfolio can be hard and if we do happen to find a company or a stock that we would like to buy, we want to make sure we are paying a fair price based on that company's financial performance.

AND to do that, we have to scan through company's financial documentation. YUCK.

Why not automate that process?

Reckoner aims to reckon a fair price for an investment i.e. evaluating a company's financials and analyst predictions automatically. Just so we can have an idea whether a certain investment is overvalued or undervalued before we deep dive into that company's business or before we make an investment.

## Evaluation Methods

- [Discounted cash flow](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp), a method that _estimates_ the value of an investment based on cash flows. This method is great for a [blue chip company](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/031915/what-qualifies-company-blue-chip.asp) such as Apple, Microsoft etc. Essentially businesses that are stable, profitable and most importantly have a growing cash flow.

- [Price-to-earnings Ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/use-pe-ratio-and-peg-to-tell-stocks-future/), a method to determine whether a company's stock is overvalued or undervalued based on it's [P/E ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-earningsratio.asp) and bench mark it against an index i.e. [S&P 500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500).

_*Note: P/E ratio evaluation method has not been implemented yet.*_

## Usage

Using [IEX Cloud](https://iexcloud.io/) as financials provider which under the hood uses [Refinitiv](https://www.refinitiv.com/en) for the cash flow projections and estimates.

- Once you have an IEX_API_KEY, create an `.env` file and add `IEX_API_KEY=<key>`
- Run `cargo run --  --tickers "AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT"`.
